            <h2>Why This Story</h2>
            <p>When Dialogue launched its first issue, I wanted to contribute a piece rooted as much in community as in
              coffee. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ciaobellacoffee" target="_blank">Ciao Bella</a> first came onto
              my
              radar through a
              friend (who I later quoted in the piece) who had
              lived in Prospect Lefferts Gardens (PLG) much longer than I had - I had only just moved into the
              neighborhood.
              When I eventually visited, looking for a café to highlight, I sat for a while and watched the flow of the
              space: the interior, the barista-customer exchanges, the way people settled in. I tried the coffee, and by
              chance I met the owners, Marco and Jessica. Putting together their presence with the place they had built,
              I recognized something that felt true to Brooklyn and to PLG in particular.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>PLG is at its heart a Caribbean neighborhood, and Ciao Bella managed to create a café that did not
              <strong>exclude that community by chasing trends or distancing itself</strong> from its
              surroundings. There are plenty of other cafés within walking distance, but this one seemed to bridge two
              currents: the newer wave of modern, style-conscious coffee culture, and the rootedness of the neighborhood
              it belonged to. After interviewing Marco and Jessica and learning how they had opened right at the edge of
              the COVID-19 lockdowns, and how they adapted with grit and community support, I was certain I had chosen
              the right story. Instead of abandoning their vision, they reshaped it into something more resilient. That
              persistence, that insistence on community even under pressure, is what made me want to tell their story.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section id="my-role" class="step" data-label="My Approach" data-index="02">
            <h2>My Approach</h2>
            <p>I knew from the start that the piece had to begin with atmosphere. My first visits to Ciao Bella left me
              holding onto small sensory anchors that carried the story forward: the sound of shots being pulled,
              sometimes by Marco himself, the hiss of steam from the steamer-wand, the shelves of records lining the
              walls with jazz and Caribbean artists, and that oversized blue velvet couch that seemed to both welcome
              and command attention at the center of the room. These were not just decorative details but signposts of
              the café's identity, and I wanted readers to enter the space in the same way I did, noticing the texture
              of it before anything else.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The <strong>nut graf</strong> built on that entry point and set up the bigger frame. It established Ciao
              Bella as more than a coffee shop, positioning it as a response to the shrinking number of cafés in
              Brooklyn where people
              could genuinely linger. For Marco, who had grown up in a small Swiss town, and for Jessica, who had seen
              how welcoming a campus café could be, the decision to create a space that encouraged connection was deeply
              personal. Their backstories and values shaped the choices they made, from the music on the walls to the
              design of the bar.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The <strong>arc</strong> of the piece followed this progression: begin with sensory immersion, move into
              the personal
              histories that explained why the café took the shape it did, and return to the present, where Ciao Bella
              had become a steady anchor for neighbors and a deliberate choice for remote workers who walked past other
              cafés just to sit at that blue sofa.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="execution" class="step" data-label="Execution" data-index="03">
            <h2>Execution</h2>
            <p>I first reached out to Marco and Jessica in February 2022 and set up a Zoom interview. By then, Ciao
              Bella had weathered the hardest phases of the pandemic and was slowly becoming an anchor in Prospect
              Lefferts Gardens. The interview gave me the backstory: how they had opened right before lockdowns, how
              quickly they had to adapt, and how their different personal histories came together in the café. Marco
              spoke about the community ties of his small Swiss hometown and the his experiences working as a barista in
              Manhattan, while Jessica described both the inclusiveness of campus coffee shops she loved and the moments
              she had felt unwelcome in Brooklyn cafés. Those reflections shaped the emotional core of the piece.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The interview also revealed how much meaning was embedded in small details: the records chosen for the
              walls, or the bar that Jessica's uncle had built by hand. These touches weren't incidental; they told as
              much about the café's purpose as any direct statement could. I wanted the narrative to hold both the
              owners' voices and my own observations, so it felt grounded in lived experience rather than just a
              retelling of their story.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In drafting, I worked to balance these layers: the intimacy of their story, the atmosphere of the café,
              and the wider context of Brooklyn's café culture at that moment. Editing meant finding the right pace, so
              the piece didn't linger too long on any single thread but gave readers enough to feel why Ciao Bella
              mattered to its neighborhood.</p>
          </section>

          <section id="design" class="step" data-label="Design & Production" data-index="04">
            <h2>Design, Collaboration & Production</h2>
            <p>From the beginning I imagined Ciao Bella paired with illustration rather than photography. I asked my
              MICA classmate at the time, Evan Manning, to experiment with line drawings that would
              carry
              the same qualities I noticed in the café: the wide blue velvet sofa at the center, the rhythm of the
              records on the walls, and the likeness of Marco and Jessica themselves. What I wanted was a style that
              felt contemporary but did not flatten or Europeanize their features, something that acknowledged them as
              they were while capturing the warmth of the space.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The early sketches focused on those visual anchors that had stayed with me; the couch in particular was
              the detail that burned into memory, a kind of shorthand for how the café held people. The illustrations
              translated those anchors into something playful and memorable. In the end, the editor decided to go in a
              different visual direction, which meant those drawings never ran in print. But that process reminded me
              how strongly I tie stories to objects and atmosphere, and how visuals can deepen the cues that text sets
              in motion.</p>

          <section id="impact" class="step" data-label="Impact" data-index="05">
            <h2>Impact</h2>
            <p>The feature appeared in the debut issue of Dialogue Magazine, placed at the center of the book. Rather
              than standing apart, it sat in harmony with the mix of stories, interview pieces, and poems that gave the
              issue its range. The choice to pair it with illustration rather than photography also created a natural
              break in the magazine's pacing, offering readers a different visual entry point between the more
              photo-forward features.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Positioned this way, the Ciao Bella piece carried weight not only as a profile but also as part of the
              issue's rhythm and design. It showed how an editorial feature could speak to community and atmosphere
              while also contributing to the flow of the magazine as an object — something that felt cohesive, layered,
              and intentional from cover to back.</p>

          <h2>Reflection</h2>
          <p>This was my first feature writing opportunity, and it taught me a great deal about shaping both the
            interview and the story. I prepared questions with the magazine's editorial goals in mind, but I also
            learned how to let the conversation guide me; when to follow a thread, when to rephrase, and when to allow
            an answer to spark the next question. I was disappointed that Evan's illustrations weren't ultimately
            chosen, but I came to understand that editorial direction sometimes means letting go of personal vision in
            service of the whole.</p>
          <br>
          <p>The hardest part was cutting the draft down so one sentiment or thread didn't linger too long. That
            discipline reminded me of what I had practiced in short story writing, where rhythm and restraint are as
            important as atmosphere. I know I lean toward descriptive, immersive writing, always wanting the reader to
            feel the emotion of a space, and this piece was an exercise in finding the balance between immersion and
            clarity.</p>
